**G’day, I’m Anupam!** :wave:

I am a Software Test Engineer and quality enthusiast based in Sydney with more than 12 years of experience in testing roles for various firms and projects. I have experience building automation frameworks from scratch for testing of Web, Mobile and API applications. I have also done Performance testing and Security Testing of various applications using open source and enterprise tools. Specifically, I have worked with tools such as Selenium, Cypress, Appium, SeeTest, Katalon Studio, Postman, Soap UI etc. I have good knowledge of coding in Java, Javascript, C# and Python.

I also have interest in [Service Virtualization](https://smartbear.com/learn/software-testing/what-is-service-virtualization/), [Shift-left approach](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-shift-left-testing) for software testing and [AI-based testing tools](https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/AI-in-Software-Testing#:~:text=superior%20customer%20experience.-,What%20is%20AI%2Dbased%20Testing%3F,process%20smarter%20and%20highly%20effective.).

In my spare time I like to play sports such as Badminton and Cricket, pursue photography, write my tech blog and travel around the globe.
