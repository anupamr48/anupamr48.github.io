Hi there! :wave:

<br>

I'm **Anupam Roy**, a test automation engineer with strong experience in designing and implementing automated solutions using open source tools. I :heart: to build scalable test automation frameworks. Always interested in investigating new tools and testing ideas.

Details about some of my personal projects can be found [here](https://anupamr48.github.io/projects/). In my free time, I like to pursue [photography](https://500px.com/p/anupamroy?view=photos) and occasionally [blog](https://royanupam.medium.com/) about things.
